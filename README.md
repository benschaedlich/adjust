# Adjust Tasks

## Task 1
### Build Instructions
Nothing to build.

### Usage
1. Open terminal if not on console
2. Change directory to the script location 
3.  Run:
		bash adjust.sh

### Description
This script simply outputs all numbers between 1 and 10 in a random order in bash. Each number is only being displayed once.

### Limitations/Bugs 
- the for loop used in is_used function is not the best in terms of performance; this is not relevant at this stage counting up to 10. However, it could be very relevant counting up to higher numbers
-the number maximum number to count up to is static
